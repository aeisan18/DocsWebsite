#  Welcome 
Hi.  I'm Adam.  

Welcome to my very much still "under construction" site where I intend to document my homelabbing and self-hosting journey.  

I have had friends and family ask me "how did you do _______" or "my _____ broke, can you help me fix it?" 

Well... I hope I can and I hope that by documenting some of my trials and errors - and even a few successes ðŸ˜‚ - I can give others some insight into what I've chosen to run in my homelab along with some of the why and the how.  

If you're interested... Come along on this journey with me!
