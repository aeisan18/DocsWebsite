## Docs Website

One of the things I want to do is put together a robust tech documents website.  That's what this site is going to be!

<!-- more -->

The site will do and be for a few things: 

* Help me keep records of how I configured some of my services, apps, network, etc. - all the things in my home lab
* Help provide friends and family with well-written and easy to follow guides on how to set things up for themselves
* General blogging to talk about things I like

The site will be mostly written in markdown.  The HTML will be converted from markdown via [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and uploaded to Github, where it will be hosted on Github Pages [here](https://adam.eisan.us).

-----------------
## Supporting Apps
I'm exploring various other markdown tools such as the app I'm writing this note in - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - and syncing the markdown files with NextCloud (<i>also self hosted, by the way</i>).  

I'm excited to explore more about markdown and all the tools out there to make this site fun and informative for me as well as others.  

Here we go!
